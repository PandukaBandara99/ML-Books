        "Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of interconnected nodes, called neurons, that process and transmit information throughout the network. Neural networks have shown remarkable success in a variety of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic building block of a neural network is the neuron, which receives input from other neurons or from external data sources. Each input is weighted according to its importance, and the neuron applies an activation function to the sum of the weighted inputs to produce an output. This output is then passed to other neurons in the network as input.\n",

        "f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^-x)\n",
        "```\n",

Each layer contains multiple neurons, and the connections between neurons are weighted according to their importance.\n",
