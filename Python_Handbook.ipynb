        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects, which are instances of classes, to structure and organize code. Python fully supports OOP, allowing developers to create classes, define attributes and methods, and create objects based on those classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Classes and Objects:**\n",
        "   - A class is a blueprint that defines the attributes and behavior of an object.\n",
        "   - To create a class, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name. Inside the class, define attributes and methods.\n",
        "   - An object is an instance of a class. You can create multiple objects based on a single class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Attributes:**\n",
        "   - Attributes are variables associated with a class or object. They hold data that describes the state of the object.\n",
        "   - Class attributes are shared among all instances of the class, while instance attributes are specific to each object.\n",
        "   - You can define attributes within the class using the `self` keyword to refer to the instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Methods:**\n",
        "   - Methods are functions defined within a class that perform actions on objects or manipulate object data.\n",
        "   - Instance methods take the `self` parameter, which represents the instance calling the method.\n",
        "   - Class methods are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator and take the `cls` parameter, representing the class itself.\n",
        "   - Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator and do not take any specific instance or class parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Inheritance:**\n",
        "   - Inheritance is a mechanism where a class inherits properties and behavior from another class, called the superclass or base class.\n",
        "   - The derived class, also known as the subclass or child class, can extend or override the attributes and methods of the base class.\n",
        "   - In Python, you can define inheritance by specifying the base class in parentheses when creating a new class.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Encapsulation:**\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of a class and providing a public interface for interacting with the class.\n",
        "   - You can control access to attributes and methods using access specifiers: public (default), private (prefixed with double underscore), and protected (prefixed with single underscore).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Polymorphism:**\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "   - It enables methods with the same name to behave differently based on the object type they are invoked on.\n",
        "   - Polymorphism in Python is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP in Python provides a structured and modular approach to programming, promoting code reuse, maintainability, and abstraction. By defining classes and objects, you can create organized and flexible code that models real-world entities or abstract concepts."

        "1. **Defining a Class:**\n",
        "   - To define a class, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name, which typically starts with an uppercase letter.\n",
        "   - The class can have attributes (variables) and methods (functions) defined within it.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Car:\n",
        "         pass\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Creating Objects (Instances):**\n",
        "   - Objects are instances of a class, created using the class name followed by parentheses.\n",
        "   - This invokes the class's special method called the constructor (`__init__()`), which initializes the object.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",

        "     my_car = Car()\n",
        "     ```\n",

        "3. **Class Attributes:**\n",

        "   - Class attributes can be accessed using the class name or any object of the class.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Car:\n",
        "         wheels = 4\n",

        "     ```\n",

        "4. **Instance Attributes:**\n",
        "   - Instance attributes are specific to each object (instance) of the class.\n",
        "   - They are defined within the class's constructor (`__init__()` method) and accessed using the `self` keyword.\n",

        "   - Methods are functions defined within a class that perform actions on objects or manipulate object data.\n",
        "   - They are defined inside the class and can access attributes through the `self` parameter.\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Class and Instance Variables:**\n",
        "   - Class variables are shared among all instances and can be accessed using the class name or any object.\n",
        "   - Instance variables are specific to each object and can be accessed using the `self` keyword.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Accessing Instance Attributes:\n",
        "   - Within a method, you can use the `self` attribute to access instance attributes.\n",
        "   - Instance attributes are unique to each object and can hold different values.\n",
        "   - By prefixing the attribute name with `self`, you can access and modify its value.\n",
